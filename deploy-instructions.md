# Deployment Instructions

## ðŸ“¦ Build Complete!

Your application has been successfully built with all the calendar integration improvements.

### ðŸš€ Ready to Deploy

All files are ready in the `deployment/` folder:
- `index.html` - Main application file
- `assets/index-C_-_p4mJ.js` - JavaScript bundle (741.90 kB)
- `assets/index-DkloNl38.css` - CSS styles (76.35 kB)
- All static assets (icons, images, etc.)

### ðŸ“‹ Upload Instructions

1. **Upload all files** from the `deployment/` folder to your web host
2. **Maintain folder structure** - keep the `assets/` folder intact
3. **Set index.html** as your main/default file

### âœ¨ What's New in This Build

**Calendar Integration Improvements:**

- âœ… Multiple fallback methods for iCloud calendars
- âœ… Smart iCloud URL detection with user guidance
- âœ… Improved error handling with actionable suggestions
- âœ… File upload method as reliable alternative
- âœ… Demo mode for testing when sync fails
- âœ… Better user experience with progress indicators

**Authentication Improvements:**
- âœ… Profile caching to reduce timeout errors
- âœ… Increased timeout duration (30 seconds)
- âœ… Better error handling and logging

### ðŸ§ª Testing on Live Environment

Once deployed, test the calendar integration:

1. **Navigate to Appointments** â†’ Click calendar icon (ðŸ“…)
2. **Try URL sync** with your iCloud calendar URL
3. **If CORS errors persist** â†’ Use the file upload method
4. **Test demo mode** if needed to see the interface

### ðŸ”§ Differences in Live Environment

The live environment may handle CORS differently:
- Some hosting providers have different CORS policies
- HTTPS vs HTTP can affect proxy behavior
- The proxy services may work better from production domains

### ðŸ“Š Bundle Size Note

The JavaScript bundle is 741.90 kB (180.72 kB gzipped). This includes:
- React framework
- Calendar parsing libraries
- All application components
- Supabase integration

This size is reasonable for a full-featured application.
