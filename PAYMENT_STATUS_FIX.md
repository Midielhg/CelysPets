# Payment Status Migration

## Problem
The groomer dashboard "Mark as Paid" functionality was failing because the `payment_status` field is missing from the `appointments` table in the database.

## Solution
Run the SQL migration to add the missing `payment_status` field to the appointments table.

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Run the SQL Migration
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `add-payment-status-field.sql`
4. Execute the migration

### 2. Verify the Migration
After running the migration, you should see:
- A new `payment_status` column in the `appointments` table
- Default value of `'unpaid'` for all existing appointments
- An index on the `payment_status` column for performance

### 3. Test the Fix
1. Navigate to the groomer dashboard at `http://localhost:5177/`
2. Try to collect payment and mark as paid
3. The payment status should now update successfully

## What the Migration Does
- Creates a `payment_status_type` enum with values: `'unpaid'`, `'partial'`, `'paid'`, `'refunded'`, `'disputed'`
- Adds the `payment_status` column to the `appointments` table with default value `'unpaid'`
- Sets all existing appointments to `'unpaid'` status
- Creates an index for better query performance

## Files Updated
- ✅ `add-payment-status-field.sql` - Database migration script
- ✅ `src/types/supabase.ts` - Updated TypeScript types to include payment_status
- ✅ `src/components/Groomer/AppointmentActionModal.tsx` - Enhanced error handling
- ✅ `src/services/groomerService.ts` - Improved error reporting
- ✅ `src/components/Groomer/GroomerDashboard.tsx` - Better error logging

## Enhanced Features Added
- Detailed error logging to help diagnose payment issues
- Better error messages showing the actual error from the database
- Verification that appointments exist before updating payment status
- Comprehensive debugging information in the console

After running the migration, the "Mark as Paid" functionality should work perfectly!
